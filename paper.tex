%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{5} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
    Device fingerprinting is a modern technique which, instead of using traditional user identifiers(e.g. cookies and local storage), leverages on existing information available from user's device.
    In this paper, we investigates the various state-of-the-art technologies for device fingerprinting and authentification systems that utilize such fingerprint information.We analyzes the trade-off between uniqueness of the identifier generated and ease of use for authentication. Lastly, we also build a simple authentification system that can be reused and extended in real-world web applications.

% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{paper}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references


%
% ACM needs 'a single self-contained file'!
% \subsection{Type Changes and {\subsecit Special} Characters}
% 
% \subsection{Math Equations}
% You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
% inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
% the three are discussed in the next sections.
% 
% \subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
% A formula that appears in the running text is called an
% inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
% \textbf{math} environment, which can be
% invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin. . .{\char'134}end}
% construction or with the short form \texttt{\$. . .\$}. You
% can use any of the symbols and structures,
% from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
% \LaTeX\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
% few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
% this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
% set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
% set in display style.  (See next section).
% 
%


%
% \subsubsection{Display Equations}
% A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
% from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
% by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
% equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.
% 
% Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
% and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
% give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
% First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
% \begin{equation}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{equation}
% Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
% the \textbf{displaymath}
% environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
% \begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\end{displaymath}
% and follow it with another numbered equation:
% \begin{equation}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f\end{equation}
% just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.
% 
% \subsection{Citations}
% Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning, clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
% conference
% proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
% in the Bibliography section of your
% article will occur throughout the text of your article.
% You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
% you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
% a key of the item cited in the proper location in
% the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
% The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
% identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
% the first author's surname and a
% word from the title.  This identifying key is included
% with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.
% 
% The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
% are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
% information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
% and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
% Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
% 
% This article shows only the plainest form
% of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
% This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
% No other citation format is endorsed.
% 
% \subsection{Tables}
% Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
% placement for them is typically the top of the page
% nearest their initial cite.  To
% ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
% environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
% the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
% in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
% be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
% horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
% on \textbf{tabular} material
% is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.
% 
% Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
% placement of the table here with the table in the printed
% dvi output of this document.
% 
% \begin{table}
% \centering
% \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
% \begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
% Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
% \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
% $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
% \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
% $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
% \hline\end{tabular}
% \end{table}
% 
% To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
% the page's live area, use the environment
% \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
% the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
% table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
% Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
% instructive to compare the placement of the
% table here with the table in the printed dvi
% output of this document.
% 
% 
% \begin{table*}
% \centering
% \caption{Some Typical Commands}
% \begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
% Command&A Number&Comments\\ \hline
% \texttt{{\char'134}alignauthor} & 100& Author alignment\\ \hline
% \texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
% \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
% \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
% \end{table*}
% % end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!
% 
% \subsection{Figures}
% Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
% best placement for them
% is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
% their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
% of figures, use the environment
% \textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.
% 
% This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.eps}
% and \textbf{.ps} files to be displayable with \LaTeX.  More
% details on each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.
% 
% \begin{figure}
% \centering
% \epsfig{file=fly.eps}
% \caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format).}
% \end{figure}
% 
% \begin{figure}
% \centering
% \epsfig{file=fly.eps, height=1in, width=1in}
% \caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
% that has been resized with the \texttt{epsfig} command.}
% \end{figure}
% 
% 
% As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
% that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
% ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
% \textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.
% 
% Note that either {\textbf{.ps}} or {\textbf{.eps}} formats are
% used; use
% the \texttt{{\char'134}epsfig} or \texttt{{\char'134}psfig}
% commands as appropriate for the different file types.
% 
% \subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
% Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
% the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
% corollaries and proofs.  There are
% two forms, one produced by the
% command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
% other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
% the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
% to compare the two in the output of this sample document:
% 
% This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
% the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
% \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
% \begin{theorem}
% Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
% an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
% \begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
% \end{theorem}
% 
% The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
% by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
% \newdef{definition}{Definition}
% \begin{definition}
% If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
% unique number which has
% logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
% \end{definition}
% 
% \begin{figure}
% \centering
% \psfig{file=rosette.ps, height=1in, width=1in,}
% \caption{A sample black and white graphic (.ps format) that has
% been resized with the \texttt{psfig} command.}
% \end{figure}
% 
% Two lists of constructs that use one of these
% forms is given in the
% \textit{Author's  Guidelines}.
% 
% \begin{figure*}
% \centering
% \epsfig{file=flies.eps}
% \caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
% that needs to span two columns of text.}
% \end{figure*}
% and don't forget to end the environment with
% {figure*}, not {figure}!
%  
% There is one other similar construct environment, which is
% already set up
% for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
% a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
% create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
% is a example of its use:
% \begin{proof}
% Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
% \begin{displaymath}
% \lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
% \end{displaymath}
% Then
% \begin{displaymath}
% l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
% = \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
% \left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
% = \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
% \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
% \end{displaymath}
% which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
% \end{proof}
% 
% Complete rules about using these environments and using the
% two different creation commands are in the
% \textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
% detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
% not listed therein, which you want to have the same
% formatting as the Theorem
% or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
% use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
% \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
% respectively, to create it.
% 
% \subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
% Because you have just been given permission to
% use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a
% new form, you might think you can
% use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a
% new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
% Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
% to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
% to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
% some or all of the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will
% be, to say the least, problematic.
% 
% \section{Conclusions}
% This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
% Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
% Appendices; brief samples of these
% follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
% we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
% of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
% this paper are to articles which have nothing to
% do with the present subject and are used as
% examples only.

% \section{Acknowledgments}
% This section is optional; it is a location for you
% to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and

% \section{Headings in Appendices}
% The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
% the body of the article are different in the appendices.
% In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
% \textbf{section} is used to
% indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
% designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
% a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
